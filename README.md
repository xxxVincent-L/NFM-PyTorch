## Data Preprocessing

Here, we use the **Movieslens dataset**. More specifically, we use **MovieLens 1M movie ratings dataset**. It's a stable benchmark dataset with 1 million ratings from 6000 users on 4000 movies and it's released 2/2003.

The data preprocessing contains two steps:

* Load the Data

    * `read_csv()`: This function has so many parameters that can simplify the code. So you have to dive deeper into it.

* Preprocess the data to meet certain requirements. 
  
    * How to transform your data into category type? 

        >It's a effective data type in terms of Recommender System.
