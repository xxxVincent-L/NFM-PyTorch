## Data Preprocessing

Here, we use the **Movieslens dataset**. More specifically, we use **MovieLens 1M movie ratings dataset**. It's a stable benchmark dataset with 1 million ratings from 6000 users on 4000 movies and it's released 2/2003.

The data preprocessing contains two steps:

* Load the Data

* Preprocess the data to meet certain requirements.
